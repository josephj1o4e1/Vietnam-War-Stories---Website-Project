## Quick Guide of Code
The website uses basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some PHP (mostly only for email sending). <br /><br />
Starting from the homepage, the Vietnam Map is capable users hovering to the exact region and learn immediately from the popup info panel. It is an SVG style map that maybe could be further improved by using a google map style coding. <br /><br />
There is a side bar containing list of videos. The filter logic from search bar or advanced filtering(affiliations/regions/years) works well together when searching for videos. <br /><br />
Going to the Glossary page you can see that all the glossaries are coded into a dropdown menu style display, where it gives the website a more clean and direct view for the users. The biggest reason for using the dropdown menu style is for users to still be able to browse through the glossary terms while other stuff is still displayed in the page. <br /><br />
The Tell Your Story page uses php as its backend, and uses PHPmailer for most of the email sending operations.
